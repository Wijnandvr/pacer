## Elements

#### Vertices

 * A vertex can contain an arbitrary set of named properties (i.e. a hash).

#### Edges

 * Edges are directed.
 * An edge must have a label.
 * An edge can contain an arbitrary set of named properties (i.e. a hash).

For more details, see [[Mutating a Graph]] and [[Working with Graph Elements]].

## Routes

A [route](Routes) is a composable, lazily-loaded collection of elements.

## Extensions

[Extensions](Pacer-extensions) are an extremely powerful tool that allows developers to:
 * Process the graph using familiar object-oriented techniques.
 * Extend graph elements with domain-specific functionality.
